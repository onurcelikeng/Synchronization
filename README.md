Marriage office has two queues, one for grooms, one for brides. Office has two marriage registrars. Each registrar needs one groom and one bride to make marriage ceremony. There is no rule about married groom and bride. They are chosen randomly or sequentially. You need to have different “c” files for groom, bride, registrar and main.
